# Stream-Hachet-Technical-Test
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello!! This is my repo for **Stream Hatchet's**  technical test.

<br>
<br>

This was a very interesting "project" for me, I learned a couple of things, reviewed other concepts, and also had the opportunity to work with the company's BI platform, which is phenomenal! 

<br>

The questions are in the **Data Engineer -Technical Test** and the answers are in  **TechnicalTest.ipynb**, you don't need to clone the repo, you **can just click the file** and github renders the notebook online.

<br>
<br>

I didn't include any requirements.txt file, since I didn't use any non in-built modules(other than numpy).

<br>

The test consists first by SQL question,to simulate my own database and input values I used SQLlite with DBeaver since it's free, this ofcourse limits yourself because SQLlite is pretty 'lite' SQL that doesn't have a lot of functions that exist for example in MySQL.
<br>
Next there's a question about API's, I have a small example on how to request data from OpenNotify's **FREE** API of NASA data about the ISS.
<br>
The next question is a logic puzzle,I made a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_4c4DdNfaY&pbjreload=10), explaining the algorithm I came up with to solve the problem,followed by an implementation in python.
<br>
Finnally the last question is an analysis question, this one doesn't have any code, it's basically a small report about insights found in the platform aswell as new features including a machine learning section that in my opinon would benefit platform users.
