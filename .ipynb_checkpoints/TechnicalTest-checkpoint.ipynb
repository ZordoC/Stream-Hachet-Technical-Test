    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a standalone software that can be installed on any computer to run containerized applications. Containerization is an approach of running applications on an OS such that the application is isolated from the rest of the system. You create an illusion for your application that it is getting its very own OS instance, although there may be other containers running on same system. Docker is what enables us to run, create and manage containers on a single operating system.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes turns it up to 11, so to speak. If you have Docker installed on a bunch of hosts (different operating systems), you can leverage Kubernetes. These nodes, or Docker hosts, can be bare-metal servers or virtual machines. Kubernetes can then allow you to automate container provisioning, networking, load-balancing, security and scaling across all these nodes from a single command line or dashboard. A collection of nodes that is managed by a single Kubernetes instance is referred to as a Kubernetes cluster.\n",

    "**Why Kubernetes Solution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. To make the infrastructure more robust: Application will be online, even if some of the nodes go offline, i.e, Reliability \n",
    "   2. To make application more scalable: If workload increases, simply spawn more containers and/or add more nodes to your Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes works with Amazon EC2, Azure Container Service, Rackspace, GCE, IBM Software, and other clouds. And it works with bare-metal (using something like CoreOS), Docker, and vSphere. And it works with libvirt and KVM, which are Linux machines turned into hypervisors (i.e, a platform to run virtual machines). <br>\n",
